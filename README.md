Easy Customer Invoices
======================

A simple, non-bloated, custom WordPress Invoicing Plugin - made for Leaves Webdesign, but probably suits other people's needs as well.

Contributions and Bugs
----------------------

If you have ideas on how to improve the plugin or if you discover a bug, I would appreciate if you shared them with me, right here on Github. In either case, please open a new issue [here](https://github.com/Leaves-Webdesign/easy-customer-invoices/issues/new)!

You can also contribute to the plugin by translating it. Among the plugin files, there is a `.pot` file which you can use as a starting point. When you're done with a translation, you can either create a pull request with the new translation files or you can send them to me manually.
